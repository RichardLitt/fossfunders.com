The FOSS Funders are a self-organized group of folks who help organizations get involved in funding their open source dependencies and infrastructure. The FOSS Funders Working group currently
meets every other week, and seeks to develop and promote decision-making frameworks than can be used by any organization that wants to play an active role in sustaining open source.

Some examples of our work:
* [The FOSS Contributor Fund](https://github.com/indeedeng/FOSS-Contributor-Fund)
* [Sentry's Funding Program](https://blog.sentry.io/we-just-gave-260-028-dollars-to-open-source-maintainers/)
